# My Audio Setup

Here are some notes for my office audio setup (listening and meetings) for those who may be curious.

Before you go out and start purchasing things. Reader, please note that folks buy audio gear for a variety of reasons including experiencing differences in audio fidelity, soundstage, space between instruments and voices, and sound balances (more bass for bassheads for example). Many variables impact the listening experience and the hardware itself is just one component. For example, how a track is mastered and the EQ of your listening environment makes a big difference. 

## Current Rig 

I will preface this current build as something that has been pieced together over many years. If I were to start over from scratch, I would most likely not make the same choices, but I am mostly satisfied with this setup. There are some annoyances, but not ones I cannot live with.

### Headphone

I currently have a pair of custom Grado headphones which I've pieced together over the years and have been using in this form since August of 2021. Looks like this.

Here is a picture from my DSLR but notice it has a different set of pads.

*	[Symphones V9](https://www.symphones.com/shop/v9) for drivers

*	Large pads (hybrid leather + merino) for L or G cushions replacement and headband come from Silvian at [Beautiful Audio](https://www.beautifulaudio.biz/grado-earpads-headbands). These were quite an investment but are well worth the money. Silvian was very kind to answer many questions before I placed my order. I would buy from Silvian again.

A note on the earpads. I wear glasses and I had a battle with finding the right pads for comfort. None of the official or cheap third-party pads worked. I tried L cush, S cush, TTJV flats, and several from Amazon. None that allowed for all-day wear and comfort. 

* The original gimbals broke on me one day a few years ago. So, I've replaced them with slim black ceramic aluminum gimbals from [shipibo.audio](https://www.shipibo.audio/).

*	I went with custom Grado SR80e woodies cups from Riley who runs [ThereWillBeDust on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ThereWillBeDust)

*	For the actual original Grado bits. I reused the SR60e cable (which required soldering) and the headband. The headband from Silvian cleverly wraps around the original headband with magnets and does help with comfort.

### DAC

* For my headphone amplifier and digital-to-analog converter, I use a [Maverick Audio Tube Magic D1](https://www.mav-audio.com/base/product/tube_magic_d1).
* I probably wouldn't buy the D1 again for a headphone amp. There are better options. One drawback is the analog tube is not included the audio chain for the headphone output.
* I have done the opamp swap on the D1 which does affect the headphone output. I'm currently using the [Supreme Sound Opamp V5i from Burson Audio](https://www.bursonaudio.com/product/supreme-sound-opamp-v5i/).

### Microphone

*	[Shure SM57](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/microphones/sm57) with [Shure A81WS](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/a81ws) windscreen
* The mic is mounted on a [Shure A55M](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/accessories/a55m) shock mount clip with a cheap, and squeaky, telescoping boom.
*	Between the SM57 and audio interface is a [FetHead](https://www.tritonaudio.com/fethead) in-line microphone preamp, because my audio interface lacks the oomph.

### Audio Interface

*	The audio interface is a [Focusrite Scarlett 2i2](https://focusrite.com/en/usb-audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-2i2). The one I have is an older generation. I've had it for probably a decade now.
